              I'm very sorry but am too tired to type another blog so have the same one but with this text as the start
            </p>
            <p>

              The meaning of life is a very hard thing to get an actual answer too. While I might have my own thoughts of what means to live I am 100% certain it isn't the only answer since after all, those are just my ideals.
            </p>
            <p>
              So instead, why don't I talk about the meaning of love?
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container blogtitle">
          <p>
              <h2>
                  <b>What does the word love mean?</b>
              </h2>
          </p>

            Scientifically love is a sort of chemical, to those people love is nothing but a value among other objects in the world, just another molecule around more atoms. For such reasons they can't enjoy it as it's meant to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Love is more than just a feeling or an emotion, to love is to see a person and admire the perfect imperfections in them, be it a friend, family member or even a loved one. Love can be compared to a tool, is a gateway to living life a different way. Through love you make relationships that change and mold your life, hopefully for the better.
          </p>
          <p>
            You share smiles, laughs, cries and memories all through this medium of emotions. Love is but a way of living and providing your life more meaning than it already has. So that one day, when you're old enough and laying on the bed you can finally say, <q>I swear, I lived.</q>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container blogtitle">
          <p>
              <h2>
                  <b>End notes</b>
              </h2>
          </p>

            Hopefully that can provide a brief summary. Though, Love is like the universe, ever expanding and filled with information.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's also a very nice way a certain "illuminated" person summarized it:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <q>
              It matters not what you've done, but what you do with what you've done for others.
            </q>
          </blockquote>
